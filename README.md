## Fixed Bugs
* Heroku Deployment Error due to pywin32 Dependency

   * Issue: The application failed to deploy on Heroku because pywin32, a package designed for Windows, was listed in requirements.txt, causing a build failure on Heroku's Linux-based environment.
   * Solution: The recommendation was to remove pywin32 from requirements.txt or conditionally include it for Windows environments only, using environment markers in requirements.txt.

* Incorrect IPython Version for Python Runtime

   * Issue: A specific version of IPython required for the project was incompatible with the Python version defined in runtime.txt, leading to deployment issues.
   * Solution: Two potential solutions were proposed: updating the runtime.txt to specify a compatible Python version or adjusting the requirements.txt to use a version of IPython compatible with the current Python runtime.

## Deployment

### Deploying to Heroku

To deploy with Heroku, Code Institute Python Essentials Template was used so the python code can be viewed in a terminal in a browser
